# ImageInk

ImageInk is an innovative platform that transforms visual content into compelling
narratives. By leveraging the power of advanced AI, this project allows users
to upload images, which are then analyzed to generate rich, descriptive, or
imaginative stories. Whether it's a simple landscape, a portrait, or a candid
snapshot, ImageInk turns every image into a story waiting to be told.
